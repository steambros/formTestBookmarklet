In the best case I want to test these forms with different values or even empty fields (to test error handling). Therefor I created this bookmarklet.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDrag this button to your browser's favorites bar:\r\n\r\nor right click on the button and select 'Add to Favorites'\r\n\r\nor step-by-step in your browser:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new bookmark.\r\n2. Choose any name for your bookmark.\r\n3. Copy the whole text of the `bookmarklet.txt` file into the bookmark's address field.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nOpen your website and click on the created bookmark â€“ Done! (Click again and you get new random values)\r\n\r\nAfter you clicked the bookmarklet you can execute `testTheForm()` to trigger the form testing from your browser's console.\r\n\r\nUse `testTheForm('emptyFields')` to test your form with (randomized) empty fields.\r\n\r\n## ToDo\r\nSelect radio buttons and checkboxes, too.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Stefanie Ambrosch\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\r\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
